# todoList-v2
This is a advanced version of todolist with some functionality in which you can create your own customList on the run coz i have used ejs route parameters to render a new page on change of the url
Suppose home page URL is https://arcane-peak-64164.herokuapp.com/example in place of example you can write your own id and use it as your personal todolist.
This also supports adding some new item and deleting previous items from the todoList.
